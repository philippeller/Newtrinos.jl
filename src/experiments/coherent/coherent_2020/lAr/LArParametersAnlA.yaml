beamExposure:
  name: Beam exposure
  value: 13.8

  name: Distance to target
  value: 27.5
  units: m

    This value was determined from a LIDAR scan of the neutrino alley target area carried out by the survey and alignment team of the SNS.

   - name: b
     value: 0.00078
     units: (keVnr)^-1
     uncertainty: 0.00009  
  comment: |
    Form of QF = a + b*T(keVnr) where T is the recoil energy in units of keVnr. This value for the QF was determined based on a linear fit to all available data points from literature in the range 0-125 keVnr. Further described in arXiv:2003.10630. Correlated errors are included where reported in the literature.
    
neutrinosPerProton:
  name: Neutrinos produced per SNS proton
  value: 0.09
  uncertainty: 0.009
  units: nu/flavor/proton
  comment: |
    This is the number of decay-at-rest neutrinos produced per incident SNS beam proton per neutrino flavor.
    The DAR neutrinos are emitted isotropically. The increase in this value from the CsI[Na] data release is due to the increased SNS proton energy.

  comment: Protons-on-target trace parameters from the SNS. The trace is well approximated by a gaussian of mean a and width b with associated errors on those parameters. This is convolved with the pi^+ and mu^+ neutrino decay lifetimes to estimate the CEvNS signal.
